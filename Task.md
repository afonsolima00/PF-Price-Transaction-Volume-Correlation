# Description

Consider fetching publicly available on-chain metrics (like daily active addresses or transaction volume) for a single cryptocurrency, integrating it with price data. Then compare how these on-chain metrics correlate with short-term market movements. Summarize your findings in a concise report or dashboard that you can easily reference for future trades. This project will deepen your research skill set, augment your existing technical data capabilities, and potentially uncover new trading signals or patterns to refine your strategies

# Notes to Self
