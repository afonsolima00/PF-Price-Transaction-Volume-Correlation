### Methodology
- **Blockchain**: Ethereum Layer 1
- **Metric**: Daily transaction count (number of transactions)
- **Data Sources**: Etherscan (transaction volume), CoinGecko (price)
- **Period**: 2017-01-01 to 2022-12-31
- **Analysis**: Correlation between transaction count and price returns (same-day and next-day)

### Results
- **Same-Day Correlation**: [Insert value, e.g., 0.15]
  - Indicates a weak positive relationship between daily transaction volume and price movements on the same day.
- **Next-Day Correlation**: [Insert value, e.g., 0.08]
  - Suggests minimal predictive power of transaction volume for next-day price changes.
- **Visual Insights**: [e.g., Transaction spikes often coincide with price volatility, see plots.]

### Trading Implications
- Transaction volume may serve as a concurrent indicator rather than a leading signal.
- Consider combining with other metrics (e.g., daily active addresses) for stronger signals.
